## 🌟 About the Project

This website is inspired by Google's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).  
It allows users to interact with pre-trained models in three categories:

- 🖼️ **Image Recognition**
- 🔊 **Sound Detection**
- 🧍 **Pose Classification**

The entire experience is built using:

- `HTML`
- `CSS / SCSS`
- `JavaScript`
- `jQuery`

📱 The website is fully **responsive** and works smoothly across all devices.
